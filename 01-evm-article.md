# What is the EVM, and Why Should a Technical Writer Care?
The **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)** is a decentralised virtual computer that runs on thousands of Ethereum nodes. It executes smart contracts, processes transactions, and updates the blockchain state globally.
## Why It Matters
For developers, the EVM powers all DApps on Ethereum.
For technical writers, it's crucial to understand how it works so we can explain smart contract behaviour, gas costs, and network interactions.

> Think of the EVM like the brain of Ethereum; without it, smart contracts wouldn't run.

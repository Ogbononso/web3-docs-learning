# web3-docs-learning
Hi, I'm Chinonso ðŸ¤—

Iâ€™m on a year-long mission to master technical writing for Web3/blockchain. I believe in the power of clear documentation to bridge the gap between complex technology and real people.

## Why I'm Doing This

I want to become a world-class Web3 technical writer and build a portfolio that shows I can document smart contracts, developer tools, APIs, and protocols. I want to be able to land jobs, contribute to open-source projects, and help others understand the blockchain space.

## What I Expect to Learn

- Blockchain fundamentals
- Writing developer tutorials, references, and guides
- Docs-as-Code tools like MkDocs & Docusaurus
- How to document smart contracts, APIs, and SDKs
- How to build and publish professional documentation sites

ðŸ“… **Start Date:** May 29, 2025  
âœ… **I commit to completing this course.**
